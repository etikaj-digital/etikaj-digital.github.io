Unlike the more aerobics-style general pilates classes, your clinical pilates treatment is tailored to your specific needs and delivered by our accredited physiotherapists in our fully equipped studio.

It all begins with a comprehensive consultation. This is followed by four one-on-one sessions to allow you to become comfortable with your program and the equipment. You can then choose to join a class (maximum of 3 participants) or continue with the one-on-one sessions.

Classes run mornings, afternoons and evenings.
