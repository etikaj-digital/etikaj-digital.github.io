Having played countless hours of football, basketball and tennis growing up, Ash spent many hours as a patient in his uncle’s physiotherapy clinic.  Whilst frustrating at the time, it helped him develop a real interest in the human body and injury management, and a career pathway was set.
 
Ash completed his Bachelor of Physiotherapy degree at LaTrobe University in 2000 and initially worked in the hospital system in Melbourne.  His interest in sports and musculoskeletal injuries then led him to work in both city and suburban private practices as an employee which allowed him to gain valuable experience working alongside many experienced physiotherapists.
 
In 2007, Ash opened Strathmore Physiotherapy & Pilates with the aim of providing all clients with access to the very best and latest research based physiotherapy and clinical pilates treatment available.  

He is very comfortable treating all musculoskeletal and sporting conditions through both “hands on” and clinically based exercise programs, especially clinical pilates. To achieve this, Ash has continually updated his knowledge base and has undertaken further study in musculoskeletal, spinal and sports treatment, dry needling, clinical neurodynamics, Ridgeway Method treatment and running mechanics.  

He had also completed Levels 1-4 DMA (Dance Medicine Australia) Clinical Pilates training.
 
In the local community, Ash has worked as the chief physiotherapist for the Strathmore Football Club in the Essendon District Football League and still continues to treat many of these footballers.  He also loves keeping fit and pushing himself physically, which he does by competing in runs and triathlons.
